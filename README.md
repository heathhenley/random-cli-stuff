### Random one-off scripts
Adding some random one-offs or helper / util scripts as they come up


### Running
Use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (why would you use anything else at this point? 😀)

Get sync'd with the deps:
```
uv sync
```

Run the cli tool:
```
uv run main.py --help
```
